Nowadays, local brands like IND횤 Clothing Line are finding innovative ways 
to connect with customers and share their unique stories. This project focuses around developing an e-commerce platform for IND횤 Clothing Line, a local brand from Angeles City, Pampanga, established in 2014. IND횤, which means "mother" in Kapampangan, embodies the concept of "where you came from" (Indung Ibatan) and represents pride in local heritage. The brand is known for promoting homegrown products, especially premium-quality yet affordable crew neck shirts made in Pampanga. With a strong focus on craftsmanship and cultural identity, IND횤 has become a beloved brand in the local community like in Angeles city and other parts of Pampanga. While a fully functional outsourced e-commerce site is not feasible at this stage, our project serves as a simulation to provide valuable insights for small businesses like Indu Clothing. This simulation will highlight the various functionalities that an e-commerce site can offer, even in a simple CRUD application format.
By demonstrating features such as product listings, a shopping cart, and basic order management, the simulation will illustrate how an online platform can enhance customer engagement and streamline sales processes. Through this exploration, Indu Clothing can gain a better understanding of the potential benefits of an e-commerce site in reaching a broader audience.
